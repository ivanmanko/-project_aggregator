# ProjectAggregator

**ProjectAggregator** is a Python utility that consolidates all files in a project into a single text file. It intelligently excludes files and directories based on `.gitignore` patterns and a customizable exclusion file (`.aggregate_exclude`). Perfect for creating comprehensive overviews or documentation snapshots of your codebase.

## Features

- **Automatic Traversal:** Recursively scans the project directory to include all relevant files.
- **.gitignore Integration:** Respects your existing `.gitignore` configurations to exclude unwanted files.
- **Custom Exclusions:** Allows specifying additional files or directories to exclude via `.aggregate_exclude`.
- **Formatted Output:** Outputs each file's content prefixed with its relative path for easy navigation.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Install the required dependencies using pip:

`pip install pathspec`

## Usage

Navigate to your project's root directory and run the script:

`python aggregate_project_contents.py -o combined_project.txt`

**Optional Arguments:**

- **Specify Output File:**

`python aggregate_project_contents.py -o your_output_file.txt`

- **Specify Special Exclude File:**

`python aggregate_project_contents.py -s your_special_exclude_file.txt`
